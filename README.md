We enhance our previous tokenizer in [vietnamese-llama2-4b-40GB](https://huggingface.co/bkai-foundation-models/vietnamese-llama2-7b-40GB) by training [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) a more extensive collection of clean Vietnamese documents spanning diverse domains such as news, book, stock, finance and laws. 
In contrast to the previous version, we follow the original LLaMA-2 paper to split all numbers into individual digits. Again, the updated tokenizer markedly enhances the encoding of Vietnamese text, cutting down the number of tokens by 50% compared to ChatGPT and approximately 70% compared to the original Llama2.

Here are our data sources:
- 53 GB  NewsCorpus (clean + dedup BinhVq's [NewsCorpus](https://github.com/binhvq/news-corpus) combined with our self-crawled data up to October 2023). Thanks [iambestfeed][https://huggingface.co/iambestfeed] for his great work in crawling news data.
- 1.3 GB Vietnamese Wikipedia (updated to October 2023)
- 8.5 GB [Vietnamese books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iambestfeeder/10000-vietnamese-books)
- 4.8 GB Vietnamese legal documents (clean and dedup)
- 1.6 GB stock news (clean and dedup)
- 43 GB Vietnamese text (subsampled from Culturax-vi)
- 2.3 GB English Books (sub-sampled from [pg19](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pg19))
- 2.2 GB English Wikipedia

- 16 GB English text (subsampled from Culturax-en)

We then merge all data sources and perform the last deduplication, resulting in a final pretraining dataset of 124 GB, including 104 GB of Vietnamese text and 20 GB of English text.

We conduct a single-epoch continual pretraining using the Llama2-7B model.

We trained the model on a DGX A100 system, utilizing four GPU A100 in 40 days (about 4000 GPU hours). 

Hyperparameters are set as follows:
- Training Regime: BFloat16 mixed precision
- Lora Config:

Please note that **this model requires further supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** to be used in practice!
